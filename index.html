    can use this to demonstrate my skills and impress potential colleges and potential employers in the future. I can
    use the expertise that this show cases in order to have better visibilty and this will allow me to gain access to
    better
    oppurtunities. A outstanding digital portfolio consists of components such as past experience, educational
    qualifications, and character traits that beneficial.<br /><br /> Essentially this portfolio shows to colleges and
    employers that I know basic HTML and CSS because knowledge of both was required in order to make this portfolio.
    This portfolio is proof that I know those concepts. Additionally as I add more and more to this portfolio it shows
    how my skills advance with experience. It additionally shows anyone looking at the portfolio that I am getting
    better at Computer Science </p>
