    <h2> About Me: </h2>





    <p>
      <br /> <br /> I am 17 years old and I am curently a senior at Allen High
      School, in Allen, Texas. I was born near Chicago, Illinois, and I moved to Texas in 2014. Some things I
      enjoy doing is reading and watching movies. I took Computer Science I two years ago and learned basic swift. Last
      year I took Computer Science II where I learned more computer science concepts and worked on project skills. This year
      in Computer Science III I hope to be able to improve my programming and leadership skills by practicing. <br /> <br />
    </p>



    <h2>Why my Digital Portfolio is important to Me:</h2> <br />
    <p>This digital portfolio is important to me because it represents and showcases my accomplishments. Specifically I
      can use this to demonstrate my skills and impress potential colleges and in the future. I can
      use the expertise that this show cases in order to have better visibilty and this will allow me to gain access to
      better
      oppurtunities. A outstanding digital portfolio consists of components such as past experience, educational
      qualifications, and character traits that are beneficial.<br /><br /> Essentially this portfolio shows to colleges
      and
      employers that I know basic HTML and CSS because knowledge of both was required in order to make this portfolio.
      This portfolio is proof that I know those concepts. Additionally as I add more and more to this portfolio it shows
      how my skills advance with experience. It additionally shows anyone looking at the portfolio that I am getting
      better at Computer Science </p>
