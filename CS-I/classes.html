    <h2> Important Classes I've Taken: </h2>
    
    <p>I took Computer Science 1 two years ago and learned
    basic swift. Last year
    in Computer Science II, I learned many topics such as recursion and L-Systems which deepened my
    knowledge of swift. I additionally self studied Java.</p>

    <br /> <br /> Computer Science 1- Taught me the basics of computer science. Also taught me swift and how to to use
    shells. I also learned how to use Computer Science practically when making a game for my ISP. <br /> <br /> Algebra
    II- This class taught me more advanced topics related to math. <br /> <br /> AP Human Geography- This class taught
    me
    how the world works <br /> <br /> AP World History- This class taught me what happened in the past.
