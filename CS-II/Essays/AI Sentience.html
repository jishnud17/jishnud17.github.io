    <h2> AI will lead to the downfall of humans: </h2>






    <p>
      In our rapidly changing society, we have gained many new advances in technology. One of the most prevalent is Artificial Intelligence or AI. AI is a widely debated topic as AI is beneficial but if not developed responsibly could be detrimental to society.
      AI is beneficial in many ways from medical equipment to personal assistants. For example, people can now tell personal assistants like Siri or Alexa to execute commands such as setting alarms or playing music. Devices like these make life more convenient the more advanced they become. Using systems like these may not seem to save much time but the time it saves no matter how small adds up over time. Another way AI can benefit is in medical equipment. For example, AI can synthesize data and learn patient information and also predict how different patients are going to react to certain treatments by cross-referencing patient records with research studies. Also, they can <q>manage data, keep patients informed, reduce costs, monitor patients, and work more effectively and efficientl</q> (Hetrick 2022). This helps doctors save the lives of many patients. AI has the capability to both save lives and make them more convenient.
      Despite the many benefits of AI, if not developed responsibly can be dangerous. For example, <q>autonomous weapons are artificial intelligence systems that are programmed to kill </q>(Rohde 2021). These systems are very deadly and are most likely very difficult to stop from going off once turned on. These devices could be very dangerous in the hands of AI. Tesla CEO Elon musk states that <q>with AI, we are summoning the demon. In all those stories where there&#39s a guy with the pentagram and holy water, it is like yeah, he&#39s sure he can control the demon. Did not work out</q> (Musk 2014). This quote exemplifies the issues with AI; It can be useful and beneficial while we control it but when we don&#39t it can be dangerous. Another example is if AI has a goal and a convenient way to do it harms others. The AI will pick the most efficient way to solve problems regardless of the cost to others.
      Overall AI can change the world for the better but it can harm just as easily. We as people should be more careful when creating AI no matter the purpose.
