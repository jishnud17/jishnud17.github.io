  <h4>Introduction</h4> 
  <h3> In our rapidly changing society, we have gained many new advances in technology. One of the most prevalent is
    Artificial Intelligence or AI. AI is a widely debated topic as AI is beneficial but if not developed responsibly
    could be detrimental to society.</h3>

  <h4>What is AI?</h4>
  <h3> AI is a machine mimicking human intelligence with traits such as learning and problem-solving. AI is used for
    many
    things like military technology and search engines. In general, AI&#39s purpose is to make something a human does
    safer
    or more convenient. There are also different variations of AI. All AI can be split into one of two types weak AI and
    strong AI. Weak AI is <q>a system designed to carry out one particular job</q> while strong AI carries out tasks
    that are
    more human-like (Frankenfield 2022). Sentient AI would be classified as strong.</h3>



  <h4>Benefits of AI</h4>

  <h3>AI is beneficial in many ways from medical equipment to personal assistants. For example, people can now tell
    personal assistants like Siri or Alexa to execute commands such as setting alarms or playing music. Devices like
    these make life more convenient the more advanced they become. Using systems like these may not seem to save much
    time but the time it saves no matter how small adds up over time. Another way AI can benefit is in medical
    equipment. For example, AI can synthesize data and learn patient information and also predict how different patients
    are going to react to certain treatments by cross-referencing patient records with research studies. Also, they can
    <q>manage data, keep patients informed, reduce costs, monitor patients, and work more effectively and efficientl</q>
    (Hetrick 2022). This helps doctors save the lives of many patients. Sentient AI has the capability to both save
    lives and make them more convenient as those types of AI will be able to think more critically.
  </h3>

  <h4>Detriments of AI </h4>

  <h3>Despite the many benefits of AI, if not developed responsibly can be dangerous. For example, <q>autonomous weapons
      are artificial intelligence systems that are programmed to kill </q>(Rohde 2021). These systems are very deadly
    and are most likely very difficult to stop from going off once turned on. These devices could be very dangerous in
    the hands of AI. Tesla CEO Elon musk states that <q>with AI, we are summoning the demon. In all those stories where
      there&#39s a guy with the pentagram and holy water, it is like yeah, he&#39s sure he can control the demon. Did
      not work out</q> (Musk 2014). This quote exemplifies the issues with AI; It can be useful and beneficial while we
    control it but when we don&#39t it can be dangerous. Another example is if AI has a goal and a convenient way to do
    it harms others. The AI will pick the most efficient way to solve problems regardless of the cost to others.
    Overall AI can change the world for the better but it can harm just as easily. We as people should be more careful
    when creating AI no matter the purpose. </h3>


  <h4>Conclusion</h4>
  <h3>Overall AI can change the world for the better but it can harm just as easily. We as people should be more
    responsible when creating AI no matter the purpose. Additionally, we should keep in mind that no matter how good the
    code is the AI will not be able to think like a person.</h3>
