    <h4>Introduction</h4>
    <h3> <q>If everyone is moving forward together, then success takes care of itself,</q> said indsustrialist Henry
      Ford.
      Humans are at their most optimal when working collaboratively. Almost all of the greatest wonders and creations
      have taken people working together towards a common goal. For example, it took 100,000 men working together to
      create the Great Pyramid at Giza. In my Computer Science class, we formed teams to work together toward creating a
      product that will benefit society. There may be decision biases that may adversely influence our team&#39;s
      decision
      making.
    </h3>

    <h4>Bandwagon Bias</h4>
    <h3> It is difficult to disagree with a large group in day to day life. This is especially true when working in a
      team. Bandwagon is defined in the dictionary as <q>an activity, group, movement, etc. that has become successful
        or
        fashionable and so attracts many new people</q>(2022). It essentially means going along wih plan or idea simply
      because many others also are going along with that plan. It can be intimidating to oppose a group, your own team
      members in particular. I think the best way to deal with this is to simply remind myself that as a member of the
      group I can share my opinion. This bias is very easy to get caught into, as when multiple team members get caught
      up in a shared idea it becomes very easy to unknowingly become apart of the group despite what you personally
      believe.
    </h3>

    <h4>Convenience Bias </h4>

    <h3>Sometimes instead of making decisions about what would make the final product better, we make decisions based on
      what would be easy. In AP Statistics, we learned about different types of sampling one of which was convenience
      sampling. This type of sampling is where the sampler picks the most easy sample group to interview although they
      may not be able to provide unbiased data. The same concept applies to the ISP team where the easiest idea will
      always seem appealing for the simple fact that it requires less work. According to the Principle of Least Effort
      or Zipf&#39;s law, people&#39;s actions are <q>the expenditure of the least amount of effort to accomplish a
        task</q>, or in
      other words people are simply lazy (Nordquist, 2019). To counter this, I remind myself of what my end goal is and
      that it isn&#39;t worth having a bad end product or one that could have been better just to avoid doing some extra
      work.

    </h3>

    <h4> Ingroup Bias </h4>

    <h3>When we need advice throughout our lives one of the first places we go to our friends. In a group when some of
      the group members are friends it is common to overlook other group members in favor of those you know. This can
      cause us to get caught up in assisting our friends and working <q>less out of consideration for the good of the
        project or business as a whole</q> (Sokolovski, 2020). It can also cause constructive opinions of other team
      members
      get ignored in favor of the the opinion of friends whose idea may be worse. This can cause resentment for being
      overlooked and an inability to accept new ideas. This can foster a negative working environment which can reduce
      productivity and collaboration. The best way to ward against this bias to be aware of other team members and make
      sure you evaluate their opinions objectively.
    </h3>

    <h4> Sunk-Cost Bias
    </h4>

    <h3>This bias goes hand in hand with convenience bias. It relates to Zipf&#39;s law and how people dislike doing a
      lot
      of work on things. When people do put effort in to an idea they become attached to it. This makes it difficult to
      accept the idea that the plan may be flawed and must be ultimately discarded. This bias can <q>cause a lot of
        friction within a group</q> due to difficulty accepting more efficient solutions to problems as the solution you
      have
      although flawed is difficult to give up on (Sokolovski, 2020). For example, when watching a movie even if it is
      boring, if you have already watched an hour of it you will stick through the movie in order for the time you have
      spent to not be wasted. To avoid this, remember the final goal and that if the final product isn&#39;t as good as
      it
      could be the time spent was wasted.
    </h3>
    <h4>Overconfidence Bias</h4>

    <h3>This is a person thinking that their ideas are superior to others and not considering the fact that they could
      be fallible.The main detriment of people like this is the usually having most of the team disliking them which is
      a direct cause to an increasingly negative work environment. Additionally, this bias can can pair with bandwagon
      bias and cause an entire team to overlook alternatives due to strong belief in their idea. Overconfidence in
      general, not limited to team collaboration, is harmful and can poorly affect any ventures an individual may
      pursue. The best way to deal with overconfidence is to simply challeng your ideas and the ideas of your group.
      Present alternatives or questions to make sure an idea is actually as good as it is believed to be.
    </h3>


    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
    <h3>Biases may be difficult and hindering to any cooperative effort, but they can be dealt with by keeping an open
      mind and always questioning ideas even your own.
