      This line graph for Bubble Sort shows the difference in efficiency between different lists of words. Bubble Sort
      goes thorugh the ordered graph very quickly as there is nothing to sort so it moves on after one pass. For reverse
      ordered, however, bubble sort times out at values of 50,000 words and above. This shows the weakness of bubble
      sort as a reverse ordered list would require many passes. Random Lists on the other hand take even longer as
      random lists would require more passes than reversed lists. This also times out at 100,000 words but suprisingly
      it works on lists of 50,000 words unlike reverse ordered lists. Bubble sort overall does very well on lists of up
      to 100 words completing them at a maximum of 7.4 milliseconds but starts taking longer as it moves on to lists of
      1000 words. In conclusion, bubble sort is best used for smaller sets of words as opposed to larger sets. <br />

      <img src="Insertion Sort.pdf" title="Insertion Sort Graph" width="800" height="600"><br /><br />

      The line graph of insertion sort is similar to bubble sort in that the ordered lists didn't take long to do
      because none of the elements needed to be moved. Unlike, bubble sort this time all 3 types of lists timed out at
      100000 words. Additionally reverse-ordered also timed out at 50,000 words which is why Ihave a point for 30,000
      words instead. The reverse ordered and random lines are very exponential with the time gratly increasing. Overall,
      insertion was more effective on random list than reverse ordered lists which can be explained by insertion sort's
      process: the sort moves each element before the elements it is lesser than. In reverse ordered lists it would have
      to move almost every element while in random lists there will be some elements that are already in the right
      position. In conclusion, Insertion sort is more efficent than bubble sort when it comes to longer lists but it is
      not suited for reverse ordered lists. When it comes to random lists insertion sort is more efficent than bubble
      sort or selection sort. <br /> <br />
      <img src="Selection Sort.pdf" title="Selection Sort Graph" width="800" height="600"><br /><br />
      The selection sort line graph is very similar to the Insertion sort line graph except that selection sort takes
      longer to do ordered lists. Different from the other two sorts is that Slection Sort times out at 100,000 words
      for ordered lists hwich is something the other sorts don't do. This because selction sort searches for the lowest
      value in the array and moves it to the front reapeatedly. Although the array is already in order the sort still
      goes through every element. However in reverse-ordered lists selection sort is the most efficent. Overall
      Selection
      and Insertion are alike. <br /> <br />

      Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort are very similar here but Bubble Sort is the most efficent. Selection Sort is the
      least efficent as it time out at 100,000 words. <br /> <br />
      <img src="Reverse Ordered List Comparison.pdf" title="Reverse Ordered Graph" width="800" height="600"><br /><br />
      Selection Sort is the best here although all 3 sorts time out at about 50,000 words and above. <br /> <br />
      <img src="Random List Comparison.pdf" title="Random Graph" width="800" height="600"><br /><br />
      Insertion Sort is the best one here but all 3 time out at 100,000 words. <br /> <br />
