    Identity: Six Confused Men Corporation, SCMC Ltd.
    <br/><br/>
    Problem: The School needs a safe and efficient way to vet people coming inside their Schools.It needs to make sure that students can get in easily and random people can’t just come in undetected. Additionally it needs to be cost effective and appease people attending their school.
    <br/><br/>
    Solution: We replace humans with EAS labels on IDs and scanners which checks each ID when students walk in.This ensures that people walking in without an ID are caught and can be notified to the school authorities to deal with the issue.This eliminates students coming in without ID and random people trying to enter.
    <br/><br/>
    Target Market: Schools that need effective security measures to ensure their schools are well protected and students are not entering without ID’s.
    <br/><br/>
    Competition: Allen ISD Human security guards who would manually check ID’s and Scanners where you have to manually place your ID up to them.
    <br/><br/>
    Revenue Streams: Schools would pay to have our easy and practical system put in place to vet the people coming into the school. Additionally companies that need to have a high level of security put in place to make sure only employees can enter the building.
    <br/><br/>
    Marketing Activities: Powerpoint presentations for school boards and school meetings. We would demonstrate and show our product in action and show how it can better secure the school.We would also talk about how it would be implemented seamlessly and at a low cost.
    <br/><br/>
    Expenses: EAS Scanners and Labels for ID’s, Labels cost two cents each when built in bulk of 20000, scanners cost $200 per door.
    <br/><br/>
