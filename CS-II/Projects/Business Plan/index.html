        Problem: Schools need a safe and efficient system to vet people entering their campus. It needs to ensure that
        students can get in easily, while preventing random people from entering undetected. Additionally, it needs to
        be cost effective, appease students and staff members, and prevent any potential intruders from stepping foot on
        campus.
        <br/> <br/>
        Solution: We integrate RFID labels into the interior of student and staff IDs, then install a scanner on common
        entrance doors, which will scan for an ID when anyone walks in. This ensures that people walking in without an
        ID are caught and will immediately be reported to campus security to assess the issue. This prevents students
        from breaking code of conduct by entering the premises without IDs, as well as random people trying to enter.
        <br/> <br/>
        Detailed Technical explanation: We will make use of RFID tags, which cost about 2 cents per tag, and integrate
        them into all student IDs. The scanners on the sides of common entrance doors will use a broken beam sensor to
        detect someone passing through, and will then scan for an RFID tag. If one is detected, nothing will happen.
        However, if one isn&#39;t detected it will flash, alerting the security guard standing nearby to pull them aside.
        Visitor tags will not include RFID tags, requiring them to be pulled aside every time they enter the campus.
        <br/> <br/>
        Target Market: Our target audience is large schools, with sizable campus populations that need cost-effective
        security measures to ensure their campus is well-protected from imposters and students
        are entering with IDs.
        <br/> <br/>
        Competition: Our main competition is relatively primitive compared to our ideas. For example, the primary
        competition is hiring security guards to manually look for students' IDs as they enter the school building. This
        isn&#39;t very effective as it&#39;s subject to human error, and they cannot realistically check and look over all IDs
        of everyone coming on to campus. We know from first hand experience how easily this system can be evaded. Using
        old IDs, blank cards, or simply hiding the picture in a jacket, are all effective methods of evading human
        detection. Our scanners would wirelessly detect tags upon entrance to the school, eliminating the use of
        outdated IDs as well as people with no ID at all.
        <br/> <br/>
        Revenue Streams: Our projected stream of revenue will mainly come from schools willing to pay to have our easy
        and practical system put in place to vet the people coming into the school. Additionally, we can make a profit
        off of any companies that need a high level of security put in place to ensure only employees can enter the
        building.
        <br/> <br/>
        Marketing Activities: We will use Powerpoint presentations for school boards and school meetings to further
        demonstrate our product in action, and illustrate how it can better secure the school. We would also discuss how
        it could be implemented seamlessly at a very reasonably low cost. We could also do limited ads to targeted
        audiences on social media platforms like Google, Facebook, Youtube, and Twitter. Our marketing plan of action
        would be to push out our ads toward the end of the school year and before school starts, so that schools have
        enough time for the implementation of our system.
        <br/> <br/>
        Expenses: The RFID system needs to be installed by a trained professional and each tag costs between .10$ and
        1.50$.A scanner to read the RFID tags can cost between 300$-400$.

        Team and Key roles:
        <br/> <br/>
        Brayden Edington works out planning <br/> <br/>
        Dylan Pettijohn is in charge of researching costs and realistic implementation. <br/> <br/>
        Sahil Patil is responsible for researching how it would realistically implemented. <br/> <br/>
        Srisaivikas Munagala is responsible for researching the logistics. <br/> <br/>
        Srijishnu Devarapalli is responsible for researching competitors. <br/> <br/>
        Madison Duch helped with grammar and copy-writing.  <br/> <br/>

        Milestones: We begin our entrepreneurial journey by advertising to Allen High School and other schools in the
        area. After presenting our vision to a multitude of school districts, we will expand our advertising to areas
        outside of our local range of schools and to businesses that need extra security implemented in their buildings.
