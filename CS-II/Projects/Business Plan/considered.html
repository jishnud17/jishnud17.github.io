            This ISP appealed to me because it seemed like an interesting idea to bring food to people&#39;s homes. I
            especially enjoyed how the food was ensured to be organic. The reason I didn&#39;t choose it however is the
            practicality. Having to grow the food as part of the isp seems impractical. Growing all the organic crops is
            a key component that doesn&#39;t seem viable.

            This caught my eye because it seemed very unique. But I do not want to do this because it doesn&#39;t seem like
            something that people would buy. A spinning TV seems like it would take up more space than it would save.
            Additionally, this product does not seem like something that requires computer science.

            I like the idea because it seems generally useful. It is a service that can be almost universally applied to
            anyone that is cooking. The reason I decided not to do it however is the fact that making an effective app
            like this would require hundreds of different combinations of ingredients. Additionally, apps like this
            already exist and this isn&#39;t adding anything new that would set it apart.

            At first, I thought the idea of creating a secure browser seemed like a good idea. But then I realized that
            making a browser from scratch seems very difficult. Additionally, the proposal doesn&#39;t really discuss what
            the browser will do. Finally, the competition is trillion-dollar companies which makes it difficult to
            outperform them.
