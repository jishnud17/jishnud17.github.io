        <h2> Considered ISPs</h2>

        This ISP appealed to me because it seemed like an interesting idea to bring food to people&#39;s homes. I
        especially enjoyed how the food was ensured to be organic. The reason I didn&#39;t choose it however is the
        practicality. Having to grow the food as part of the isp seems impractical. Growing all the organic crops is
        a key component that doesn&#39;t seem viable.

            target="_blank">TV360</a>
        <br />
        This caught my eye because it seemed very unique. But I do not want to do this because it doesn&#39;t seem like
        something that people would buy. A spinning TV seems like it would take up more space than it would save.
        Additionally, this product does not seem like something that requires computer science.

        <br />

        I like the idea because it seems generally useful. It is a service that can be almost universally applied to
        anyone that is cooking. The reason I decided not to do it however is the fact that making an effective app
        like this would require hundreds of different combinations of ingredients. Additionally, apps like this
        already exist and this isn&#39;t adding anything new that would set it apart.

        <br />

        At first, I thought the idea of creating a secure browser seemed like a good idea. But then I realized that
        making a browser from scratch seems very difficult. Additionally, the proposal doesn&#39;t really discuss what
        the browser will do. Finally, the competition is trillion-dollar companies which makes it difficult to
        outperform them.

            target="_blank">Symptoms Quiz</a>
        <br />
        This one seemed interesting because it solves a problem that many people have. However similar to the isp that
        compiled ingredients I think realistically that it would be too difficult to compile all possible symptoms.
        Furthermore, many diseases and illnesses have common symptoms such as headaches or sore throats. Overall I&#39;m
        dropping this one because it seems overly difficult and impractical.

        <br />
        This seemed interesting to think about and something that would make eating out more convenient. It seems like
        the app itself seems like something that could be done. I think however that getting permission and support from
        restaurants would be difficult to acquire. Additionally, this would make competing with other apps that already
        have restaurant support difficult. This is why ultimately I moved on from this ISP.

        <br />
        This project seemed intriguing because this was definitely a problem. Nevertheless, this is something that
        doesn&#39;t seem plausible because changing traffic lights isn&#39;t something that the government would allow.
        Emergency services do it rarely during situations that need it. I don&#39;t think students being late to class
        is
        something that the government would view as important enough to warrant being able to change lights. Overall
        this is a good idea but not one that can be implemented.

            target="_blank">SchoolFood</a>
        <br />
        I think this is a great idea because many people have this problem at lunch. I also think this is something that
        Allen ISD would help invest in for the school. I also think that there is a lot of profit potential in this as
        Allen ISD and other schools would be happy to switch from school pay. While I think this is a great idea, I
        won&#39;t join this ISP because I think the one I already am in has as much potential as this. I do want this to
        be
        a success though.

        I liked this idea because it seemed like it solved a problem that I commonly have with my friends. However, I
        don&#39;t see what is stopping the friends from disagreeing on what criteria to put into the app. Additionally,
        using this app doesn&#39;t solve any problem that people can&#39;t fix on their own. Overall I don&#39;t think
        it is
        beneficial enough.

        <br />
        We choose to endorse our own project because we feel it has a valid marketing strategy, has a target audience in
        mind, and has a problem that we provide a good solution to. Our project idea is to implement RFID scanners into
        entrances of schools so that the schools can see who has an ID when entering the school and who doesn&#39;t.
        This
        ensures that people who don&#39;t go to the school can&#39;t enter undetected and that students without ID&#39;s
        are caught.
        This would replace the security guards that usually check the ID&#39;s. This would free up the labor and would
        ensure that people can&#39;t just sneak into the building in a large crowd and remain undetected. The project
        also isn&#39;t very costly because the RFID chips are very inexpensive and the scanners only need to be
        implemented in the entrances of the schools.
