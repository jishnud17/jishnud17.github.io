        (Software) Development Engineer

        <br /><br />
        Development engineers conceptualize and design products for the team or company. These products can vary
        from medical equipment to cell phones. These engineers are tasked with implementing the project and creating the
        product based on the concept idea. In short the bulk of the actual product design is the responsibility of
        Development engineers.
        <br /><br /><br />
        QA Engineer
        <br /><br />
        Their job is to essentially review the work of other team members and make sure it is the best that it can be.
        Their job is also creating test cases for the code to make sure it efficiently and accurately performs all the
        tasks it needs to do. They also need to make sure testing is coordinated and finished within the deadline.
        Additionally, they work with the development engineer to make sure that the product works as planned.
        <br /><br /><br />
        Project Manager
        <br /><br />
        The project manager organizes and leads the team. The manager defines the product goals and is ultimately
        responsible for the success or failure of the project. They also do things like create a budget and resolve any
        potential problems the project may run into. Overall the project manager keeps the team on track and working
        toward the goal.
        <br /><br /><br />
        Product Manager
        <br /><br />
        The product manager overviews the development engineers and QA engineers. They essentially lead the creation of
        the final product. They are in charge of overviewing the development of the product. They must also keep track
        of the timeline and ensure the product is being completed in a timely manner.
        <br /><br /><br />
        Release Engineer
        <br /><br />
        These engineers are responsible for making sure the source code is stored in repositories. These engineers in
        our project mainly just manage the GitHub repositories. These engineers are important as without proper backups
        of code product design becomes risky in case something doesn&#39;t work out.
