        The main branch of our Github stopped working so I needed to fix it.

       Our ISP is going very smoothly and progress is very rapid.

        Interpersonal Challenges
        <br /><br />
        There are no interpersonal challenges as everyone doing work on the ISP is working together smoothly.

        We got the NWS API linked up so you can view weather events on the App. We also presented our project this week to the class. 
        <br /><br /><br />
        Scheduling Challenges
        <br /><br />
       Between a combination of Mr. Ben being back and us realizing our deadline is coming up progress has resumed again on our ISP.
        <br /><br /><br />
        Interpersonal Challenges
        <br /><br />
        We've had more progress this week than the last 2 weeks combined as everone needs to have 3 commits by Friday.
        <br /><br /><br />

        <br /><br />
        Nothing was really done this week. We still need to add the National Weather Service API and implement UIkit.
        <br /><br /><br />
        Scheduling Challenges
        <br /><br />
        Some of our members are in Maryland for a Cybersecurity competition so progress wan't really made this week. So we have less time to finish our product.
        <br /><br /><br />
        Interpersonal Challenges
        <br /><br />
        None of us did any work on the ISP this week.

        No one except our project manager did any work on the ISP this week. His fix made the UI more readable.

        None of us did any work on the ISP this week. Which gives us more work to do later on.

        Technical Challenges
        <br /><br />
        There was an issue with merging that caused a lot of errors. However that was easily fixed as commits can be
        easily reversed. After that we had a few issues with actual errors.
        <br /><br /><br />
        Scheduling Challenges
        <br /><br />
        We had a lot of the week off so not much work got done.
        <br /><br /><br />
        Interpersonal Challenges
        <br /><br />
        More people on our ISP are contributing especially for creating the slides and posters.

        One of our team members figured out the camera issue and now we are back on track for the ISP.
        <br /><br /><br />
        Scheduling Challenges
        <br /><br />
        We all had a very busy week but we all still got our ISP moving forward at a steady pace.

        <br />
        Technical Challenges
        <br /><br />
        We are struggling to get the camera to jump the user's current location. We think the solution has something to
        do with viewport. The Mapbox documentation is difficult to understand as well.
        <br /><br /><br />
        Scheduling Challenges
        <br /><br />
        The issue with the camera is slowing us down a little but we can most likely catch up pretty easily in the
        coming weeks.
        We don't really have any problems with time.
        <br /><br /><br />
        Interpersonal Challenges
        <br /><br />
        Most people on our ISP aren't contributing to the coding, but it isn't really a problem as the ISP is still
        going smoothly.

        Technical Challenges
        <br /><br />
        I had some difficulties setting up the new repository as we moved repositories. I also had issues with getting
        contentview to work on Xcode. Howfever, I figured it all out in the end.
        <br /><br /><br />
        Scheduling Challenges
        <br /><br />
        There weren't really any issues with scheduling as our ISP team got all work done in a timely manner. I don't
        expect scheduling issues to arise in
        the future.
        <br /><br /><br />
        Interpersonal Challenges
        <br /><br />
        There aren't really many except that our ISP team has more people than necessary. The actual work element of our
        ISP is pretty small.
        <br /><br /><br />

        <br />
        <br />
        Technical Challenges
        <br /><br />
        We needed to create a file called .netrc. It is the API key that lets the app connect to the API. We had some
        difficulties setting it up.
        <br /><br /><br />
        Scheduling Challenges
        <br /><br />
        There weren't really any issues with scheduling as our ISP team got all work done in a timely manner. However we
        may need to all be assigned specific jobs to keep the pace faster. I don't expect scheduling issues to arise in
        the future.
        <br /><br /><br />
        Interpersonal Challenges
        <br /><br />
        There were some arguments between team members due to conflicting ideas about how the project should be run. It
        wasn't really that large of a conflict. However, problems like these may arise in the future.

        Technical Challenges
        <br /><br />
        While setting up the repository there were some difficulties with understanding the interface and being able to
        create issues smoothly. I personally made some mistakes with creating issues. After that there were difficulties
        with connecting the repository with each of our respective directories. However, the problems were quickly
        resolved and I know now how to fix them if they arise in the future.
        <br /><br /><br />
        Scheduling Challenges
        <br /><br />
        There weren't really any issues with scheduling as our ISP team got all work done in a timely manner. However, I
        expect this to change in the future as we start moving further with the project and have more responsibilities
        assigned to us. As one of the larger ISP groups we may do better on timing than other groups.
        <br /><br /><br />
        Interpersonal Challenges
        <br /><br />
        Our primary interpersonal challenges were all related to the assigning of the roles. There were a few debates
        about who would be best to be a manager. Fortunately in the end all the roles were finalized and out group can
        move forward in the project.
        <br /><br /><br />
        <subhead>2-Jan-2023</subhead>
        <br />
        <br />
        (Software) Development Engineer

        <br /><br />
        Development engineers conceptualize and design products for the team or company. These products can vary
        from medical equipment to cell phones. These engineers are tasked with implementing the project and creating the
        product based on the concept idea. In short the bulk of the actual product design is the responsibility of
        Development engineers.
        <br /><br /><br />
        QA Engineer
        <br /><br />
        Their job is to essentially review the work of other team members and make sure it is the best that it can be.
        Their job is also creating test cases for the code to make sure it efficiently and accurately performs all the
        tasks it needs to do. They also need to make sure testing is coordinated and finished within the deadline.
        Additionally, they work with the development engineer to make sure that the product works as planned.
        <br /><br /><br />
        Project Manager
        <br /><br />
        The project manager organizes and leads the team. The manager defines the product goals and is ultimately
        responsible for the success or failure of the project. They also do things like create a budget and resolve any
        potential problems the project may run into. Overall the project manager keeps the team on track and working
        toward the goal.
        <br /><br /><br />
        Product Manager
        <br /><br />
        The product manager overviews the development engineers and QA engineers. They essentially lead the creation of
        the final product. They are in charge of overviewing the development of the product. They must also keep track
        of the timeline and ensure the product is being completed in a timely manner.
        <br /><br /><br />
        Release Engineer
        <br /><br />
        These engineers are responsible for making sure the source code is stored in repositories. These engineers in
        our project mainly just manage the GitHub repositories. These engineers are important as without proper backups
        of code product design becomes risky in case something doesn&#39;t work out.
        <br /><br /><br />
