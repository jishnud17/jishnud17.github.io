      <h2>Merge Sort:</h2>
      <br /> <br />
    Merge Sort works by repeatedly dividing the unsorted list into smaller halves until each sublist contains only one
    element.
    Then, it merges these sublists back together in a sorted order.
    It's like breaking down a problem into smaller parts, solving them, and then combining the solutions to get the
    final result.<br /> <br />
  </p>
    
  <p>
    <h2>Quicksort:</h2>
    <br /> <br />
    Quicksort chooses a 'pivot' element from the list and partitions the other elements into two sublists: those less
    than the pivot and those greater than the pivot.
    It then recursively sorts the sublists. The sorted sublists are then combined to get the final sorted list.
    It's like organizing things by picking a reference point, putting smaller things on one side and bigger things on
    the other, then repeating the process for those smaller and bigger groups.
  </p>
<p>  <br /> <br />
  <h2>Heapsort:</h2>
  <br /> <br />
    Heapsort uses a data structure called a 'heap' which ensures that the largest (or smallest) element is at the root.
    It repeatedly removes the root and rebuilds the heap until all elements are removed.
    Think of it as organizing items like a priority queue, where the biggest (or smallest) item is dealt with first, and
    this process continues.<br /> <br />
  </p>
<p><br /> <br />
  <h2>Time Complexity:</h2> Quicksort is often the fastest, especially on average. Merge Sort and Heapsort have similar time
    complexities, but Merge Sort is more consistent in performance.
  </p>   <br /> <br />
<p>  
  <h2>Space Complexity:</h2> Merge Sort uses extra space to merge sublists, so it generally needs more space compared to
    Quicksort and Heapsort.<br /> <br />
